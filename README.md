EcoBuilders is a citizen-driven platform dedicated to transforming Sofia into a greener, cleaner, and healthier city. By combining real-time air quality data, interactive visualizations, and community engagement tools, the platform empowers people to actively participate in the improvement of urban nature. Citizens can explore how Sofia looks today, imagine how it could look tomorrow, and take part in initiatives that bring this vision to life.

Through gamification, rewards, and transparent information, EcoBuilders motivates positive environmental behavior and builds a strong eco-community. The platform connects residents, schools, NGOs, local government, and businesses, encouraging collaboration on green projects that reduce pollution, expand urban greenery, and raise awareness about environmental challenges.

EcoBuilders is more than a platform—it is a movement. By giving citizens both the knowledge and the tools to act, we turn individual motivation into collective impact, proving that together we can redesign Sofia’s future and set an example for other cities in Bulgaria and beyond.
